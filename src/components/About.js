        <h2>How we're changing things</h2>
        <p>Homeownership is a huge part of our economy. Housing overall is a $33 trillion business, and mortgages account for $15 trillion. Yet home finance operates in the same way it has for decades — through opaque systems and expensive intermediaries whose interests are misaligned with consumers’.</p>

           <p> That’s why Better.com is redefining the homeownership process from the ground up. We’re using technology to make it faster and more efficient, and humans to help make it friendly and enjoyable.</p>
